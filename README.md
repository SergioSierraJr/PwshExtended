# Pwsh Extended
PwshExtended(or PE for short) is a small extenstion for powershell but may grow larger.
I created this because there are some things in powershell that I wanted. 
So I decided to add them via c# powershell Cmdlets. 

# Features
New features will be added in time. Current features include:
### Path utils
* Add-Path - adds a directory to path
* Remove-Path - removes a directory from path(cant remove system added path)
* Sync-Path - sync's path with ExtraPaths.xml file(mostly used by other path utils) \
